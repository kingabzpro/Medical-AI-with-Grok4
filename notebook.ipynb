As MedGuide AI, I'll cover the prescribed duration for each medicine, their common availability (based on general knowledge in most countries like the US, UK, or India—availability can vary by location and regulations), and approximate prices (these are estimates and can fluctuate based on brand, location, pharmacy, and whether it's generic or branded; I recommend checking with a local pharmacy for exact details). Remember, I'm not a substitute for professional medical advice—always follow your doctor's instructions and consult them if you have questions.\n",

      "### 1. **Paracetamol 500mg**\n",

      "   - **Availability**: Very commonly available over-the-counter (OTC) in most pharmacies, supermarkets, and online stores (e.g., via Amazon or local apps like CVS or Boots). No prescription is typically needed for this strength, but it's always good to confirm with your pharmacist.\n",
      "   - **Approximate Price**: Around $0.10–$0.50 per tablet (generic versions are cheaper). A pack of 10 tablets might cost $1–$5 (e.g., $2–$3 in the US for a generic brand like Tylenol equivalent).\n",

      "   - **Availability**: Commonly available but usually requires a prescription from a doctor, as it's an antibiotic. You can find it at most pharmacies (e.g., Walgreens, local chemists) or online with a valid prescription. It's widely stocked due to its common use.\n",
      "   - **Approximate Price**: Around $1–$5 per tablet (generic is cheaper). A pack for a 3-day course might cost $3–$15 (e.g., $5–$10 in the US for a generic like Zithromax equivalent).\n",
